# **App Name**: AgriSight

## Core Features:

- Price Prediction: Predict crop prices (potato, apple, pulses) using an AI/ML (LSTM model). The AI tool will provide current price, 1-month forecast, 3-month forecast, and a recommendation (sell now or store).
- Policy Simulator: Simulate trade deal impacts by allowing input of tariff changes (-10% to +10%) and displaying the effects on farm prices, farmer income, and consumer prices.
- Buyer Matching: Connect farmers directly with buyers. Farmers can enter crop type, quantity, location, and find nearby buyers with distance and offered price.
- API Endpoints: Implement API endpoints for all three features, initially populated with mock data for testing and demonstration.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Earthy green (#8FBC8F) to represent agriculture and nature.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a very desaturated shade of the primary color to maintain a clean, soft feel.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#D2691E), an analogous hue, to highlight important calls to action and key information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif font suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a grid layout to organize information, along with cards to highlight different features and data points. Ensure a clean, mobile-friendly responsive design.
- Employ clear and intuitive icons to represent different crop types, policy impacts, and buyer information, aiding quick understanding.
- Implement subtle animations and transitions to enhance user engagement, such as loading indicators for price predictions or smooth transitions between policy simulation results.
